Koki Recipe

 Ingredients:

	2 cups black-eyed peas

	1 cup palm oil

	1 onion, chopped

	2-3 hot peppers (to taste)

	2 maggi cubes

	Salt to taste

	Banana leaves or foil for wrapping

 Steps:

	Soak beans: Soak black-eyed peas overnight, then remove skins by rubbing.

	Grind paste: Blend beans with onions, peppers, and a little water into thick paste.

	Mix: In bowl, combine bean paste with palm oil, maggi, and salt. Mix well.

	Prepare wraps: Cut banana leaves, briefly heat to soften, or use foil.


 Wrap:
       Place portions of mixture in leaves/foil and fold into parcels.

 Steam:
       Arrange parcels in pot, add water halfway up, cover tightly.

 Cook: 
       Steam for 1-1.5 hours until firm, adding water if needed.

       Cool slightly before serving.

Serve warm as main dish with boiled plantains, yams, or bread.

Tip: The mixture should be thick, not watery. Proper steaming ensures firm, cooked koki!
