Popcorn Recipe

 Ingredients:

	½ cup popcorn kernels

	3 tablespoons oil (vegetable or coconut)

	Salt to taste

	Butter (optional)

 Steps:

	Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat.

	Test heat - add 2-3 kernels, cover and wait for them to pop.

	Add kernels - when test kernels pop, add remaining kernels in single layer.

	Cover with lid slightly vented to let steam escape.

	Shake gently as kernels begin popping to prevent burning.

	Remove from heat when popping slows to 2-3 seconds between pops.

	Season immediately with salt and melted butter if desired.

	Serve warm.

	Quick Tips:

	Don't overcrowd the pot

	Keep lid slightly open for crispier popcorn

	Season while hot for better flavor absorption

 Variations:
	 Add cheese powder, caramel, or chili powder for different flavors!

	 Ready in under 10 minutes!
