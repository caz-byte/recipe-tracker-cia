Ingredients you'll need:

    Ladyfingers: I buy them, but you could make them from scratch.
    Mascarpone: it wouldn't be true tiramisu without mascarpone, but if you absolutely must, you could substitute cream cheese.
    Coffee: I use espresso
    Heavy Whipped cream
    Granulated Sugar
    Vanilla extract: or substitute imitation vanilla
    Cocoa powder: for dusting on top

The ingredients needed for tiramisu including ladyfingers, espresso, mascarpone, cocoa powder, cream, vanilla and sugar.

How to make Tiramisu:

    Mix creamy filling. Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla together until stiff peaks.
    Dip lady fingers. Add the espresso and liqueur (if using) to a shallow bowl and dip the lady fingers on both sides (don't let them soak–just a quick dip!)
    Layer mascarpone. Smooth a layer of the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture on top of the lady fingers.
    Repeat. Add another layer of lady fingers (dipped in coffee and liqueur) and another layer of cheese mixture. Dust with cocoa powder.

Process photos for layering tiramisu including dipping ladyfingers in espresso, layering a dish, adding mascarpone cream, layering again and topping with cocoa powder.

What kind of alcohol is used in tiramisu?

Tiramisu can be made with or without alcohol. This recipe calls for coffee flavored liqueur because I like that it enhances the coffee flavor.

Alcohol free: Leave it out completely.

Alcohol variations: use dark rum, brandy, marsala wine.

Espresso substitutions:  coffee, decaf
MAKE AHEAD AND FREEZING INSTRUCTIONS:

Tiramisu is even better when made in advance, allowing the flavors to blend! It will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

To freeze, make completely, but don’t dust with cocoa powder. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then tinfoil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and dust with cocoa powder a few hours before serving.
