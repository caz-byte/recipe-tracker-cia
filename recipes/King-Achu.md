Achu Recipe

 Ingredients:

	--> 1 kg cocoyams

	--> 2 cups limestone (akanwu/kanwa) - for traditional preparation

	--> 2 cups palm oil

	--> 2 maggi cubes

	--> Salt to taste

	--> Water

 For the soup:

	Cow skin (kanda), beef, or tripe

	1 onion, chopped

	2-3 yellow peppers (achu spices)

 Steps:

	Cook cocoyams: Peel and boil cocoyams until very soft (45-60 mins).

	Prepare meat: Boil cow skin/beef with onions and salt until tender.

	Make paste: Pound cooked cocoyams in mortar until smooth (or blend).

	Activate oil: Dissolve limestone in little water, strain into palm oil.

	Mix soup: Whisk activated palm oil with meat stock until yellow and thick.

	Season: Add maggi, salt, and crushed yellow peppers to soup.

	Combine: Mix in cooked meat and kanda.

	Serve achu paste with yellow soup poured around it.

	Traditional: Eat with washed hands - form paste into balls and dip in soup.

Tip: Proper oil activation gives the characteristic yellow color and smooth texture!
