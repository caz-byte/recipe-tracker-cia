	2 onions, chopped

	3 garlic cloves, minced

	2 maggi cubes

	Cook meat: Boil meat with onions, maggi cubes, and salt until tender. Save the stock.

	Make peanut paste: Grind peanuts into paste or mix peanut butter with some stock.

	Sauté: Heat palm oil, sauté onions and garlic until fragrant.

	Combine: Add peanut paste, bitter leaves, and meat stock. Stir well.

	Add protein: Include cooked meat and shrimp/fish.
