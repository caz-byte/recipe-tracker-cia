Okok Salé (Savory) Recipe 

Ingredients:

    Finely chopped okok (Eru/Okazi) leaves
    Meat (beef, goat, or smoked fish) and/or cow skin (kanda)
    Palm oil
    Groundnut (peanut) paste (optional)
    Crayfish (ground)
    Habanero pepper (optional, to taste)
    Seasoning cubes and salt to taste
    Waterleaf or spinach (optional, added for bulk/texture) 

Instructions:

    Prepare the meat: Cut meat into bite-sized pieces and cook in a pot with salt and seasoning until tender. Add offal like tripe or cow skin during this stage.
    Prepare the leaves: Wash the okok leaves thoroughly. If using dry leaves, soak them overnight.
    Combine ingredients: Add the okok leaves to the pot with the cooked meat. If using spinach or waterleaf, add them now and cook without covering the pot to preserve color.
    Add flavorings: Stir in the crayfish, habanero pepper, and adjust salt and seasoning.
    Cook down: Allow the mixture to cook, stirring intermittently. The okok does not need much water; add a little if it gets too dry.
    Incorporate fats: Once the okok begins to soften, add the palm oil (and groundnut paste, if using) and mix well.
    Simmer: Cook on low heat until the palm oil is fully incorporated and the dish is done. 

Okok salé is typically served with boiled cassava, fufu, or plantains.
