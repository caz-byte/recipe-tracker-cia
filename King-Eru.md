Eru Recipe

 Ingredients: 

	500g eru leaves (or spinach + water leaves)

	500g beef, cow skin (kanda), or fish

	2 cups palm oil

	2 onions, chopped

	3 garlic cloves, minced

	2 maggi cubes

	1-2 cups crayfish, ground

	Salt and pepper to taste

	Waterleaf (optional, for texture)


 Steps:

	Prepare leaves: Wash eru leaves thoroughly. If using dried eru, soak first.

	Cook meat: Boil meat with onions, maggi, and salt until tender. Save stock.

	Sauté base: Heat palm oil, sauté onions and garlic until golden.

	Add crayfish: Stir in ground crayfish and cook for 2 minutes.

	Combine: Add eru leaves and meat stock. Mix well.

	Add protein: Include cooked meat and kanda (cow skin).

Simmer: 
	Cook on low heat for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.	


Adjust:
	 Add waterleaf if too thick, or cook longer if too watery.

	 Serve hot with garri, fufu, or wheat dumplings.


Tip: The quality of palm oil and crayfish determines the flavor. Stir well to prevent burning!
